# Cypher From OpenAi

This is an interesting app.
 we chat with openai to get data from our neo4j database (insurance company database). Ai understands our intents and returns a neo4j cypher query by which we get our data from the database.

 All of the backend magic works behid the screen so for user its asking and geting data. You can use this app to research about your database.
